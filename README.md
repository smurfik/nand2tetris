# Building a Modern Computer from First Principles

## [Nand2tetris](http://nand2tetris.org)

The Nand2Tetris course guides students and self-learners through the construction of a modern, full-scale computer system - hardware and software - from the ground up. In the process, the students practice many major computer science (CS) abstractions studied in typical CS courses and make them concrete through 12 guided implementation projects.

The course consists of a series of 14 learning modules. Each module consists of a project, a lecture, and a book chapter.
